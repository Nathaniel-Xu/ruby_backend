what is != and where should you use it?
!= means not equal, it returns true if the arguments are not equal and false if
they are. You should use it to determine if two things are not equal.

put ! before something, like !user_name
it would return the opposite boolean of the object

put ! after something, like words.uniq!
this usually signifies a method that mutates argument, though not all mutating
methods use !

put ? before something
it would return an error as ? is not a method

put ? after something
this usually signifies a method that returns a boolean

put !! before something, like !!user_name
will return the boolean form of the object
